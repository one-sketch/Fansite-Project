      <p class="food">
  Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change.
 Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria,
  Korean cuisine reflects a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.
Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and (at least in South Korea) meats.
Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes (반찬; 飯饌; banchan)
that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal.
Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste),
soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochugaru (pepper flakes), gochujang (fermented red chili paste)
and napa cabbage. Ingredients and dishes vary by province.
Many regional dishes have become national, and dishes that were once regional
have proliferated in different variations across the country. Korean royal court cuisine once brought all
of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family.
 Foods are regulated by Korean cultural etiquette.

      <p>Korean people have developed unique architectural techniques to build housing that is properly adapted to the natural environment,
        providing dwellers with better protection. One of the distinctive features of the hanok
        (traditional Korean house) is an underfloor heating system called ondol.
        Ondol, which literally means “warm stones” and was developed during the prehistoric period,
        refers to the system of channels running beneath the stone floor of a room through which heat is
        delivered from the fireplace in the kitchen. It is also designed to effectively draw out the smoke
        through the under-the-floor passages connected to the chimney.

        While traditional Korean houses are generally wooden structures,
        they can survive as long as other buildings made with other materials if properly taken care of.
        Presumed to have been built in the early 1200s, the Geungnakjeon Hall of Bongjeongsa Temple in Andong,
        Gyeongsangbuk-do, is Korea’s oldest extant wooden building.
        The ideal location for hanok is believed to have hills or mountains at the back of the house to
        prevent the cold wind and a stream or river in front to ensure easy access to water.
        Houses built in such a place create a great harmony with the surroundings,
        attracting more and more admirers at home and abroad.

        These days, over 60% of Seoul’s population live in modern apartments, but, interestingly, these tall,
        multistoried buildings are almost without exception furbished with a heating system inspired by the age-old ondol system.
        Similarly, newly built detached houses are also reliant on its legacy to heat the floor,
        although the traditional heat passages are now replaced with under-floor metal pipes with running water heated either by gas or electricity.
        This traditional Korean heating system has been gaining more popularity not only in South Korea but also in other countries with
        wide variations in daily temperature.
