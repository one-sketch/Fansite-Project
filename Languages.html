    The Korean language is part of a northern Asian language known as Altaic,
    that includes Turkish, Mongolian and Japanese, suggesting early Northern migrations and trade.
    Korean was also heavily influenced by Chinese,
    but have adopted its own writing system in the 16th century.

  Precisely because Korean is such a radically different language from English,
  it’s normal to not even know where to begin and how to approach it.
  This is true even if you’re further along in the learning process and just need an extra self-given push to fluency.
  Where to begin, without the guidance of a teacher or curriculum?
